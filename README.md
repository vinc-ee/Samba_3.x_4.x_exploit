# Samba_3.X_4.X_Exploit

I created this script to avoid using Metasploit-framework, because it's not useful for studying. 👾

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!
